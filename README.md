# OpenWeatherMap

It is a simple Joomla module used to display weather imformation using https://openweathermap.org/ APIs. It shows both current & 5 day weather forecast. Just download and install the module. Configure the API key and module position and you are good to go. 

##### Please Note:
It is just an initial comit at the moment, therefore the UI is not very intuitive and also not production ready.
